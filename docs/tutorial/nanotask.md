# Upload Nanotasks

Now you saw how the templates and the flow you created worked to build up your annotation project.  
*But*, didn't you see some things a bit weird?
You might be thinking something like:
- What's the point of being shown and annotating the same pair of images again and again? (Do I have to make thousands of similar templates for my real annotation tasks?)
- ~~Isn't it annoying for annotators to be asked every time what is in the right card? Can't I just ask that when it is necessary?~~  <span style="color:red">To be addressed soon</span>

Yes, those are certainly reasonable questions! No worries, there are ways to handle them.

## Nanotasks

**Nanotasks** are instances of tasks that is rendered by using the same template, all of which share the same set of parameter fields but each of them can have the different parameter values.  
For instance, `main1`, the task template for image labeling, is not intended for annotating only a certain couple of images.
Rather, it is just a **template**, literally; actual contents to be dynamically rendered on this single template are possessed by nanotasks, and each one of the nanotasks are loaded at the time a worker enters the template according to the flow.

Let's take a look at `Main.vue` for `main1` template. In the HTML part of the code, you can see that the source URLs of the images (i.e., `:src` attribute in `<v-img>`) look like some sort of object variables (e.g., `nano.data.img_url0`)  but not hard-coded URLs.

```main1/Main.vue

<template>
    <v-container pa-10>
        <div class="text-h4">Main-1</div>

        <v-card max-width="1000" class="mx-auto my-6 pa-6">
            <v-row align="center">
                <v-col cols="5">
                    <v-card class="pa-3" color="grey lighten-4">
                    <v-img height="300" :src="nano.data.img_url0" contain>

                        <template v-slot:placeholder>
                            <v-row class="fill-height ma-0" align="center" justify="center">
                                <v-progress-circular indeterminate color="grey lighten-1"></v-progress-circular>
                            </v-row>
                        </template>

                    </v-img>
                   </v-card>
                </v-col>
                <v-col cols="2" align="center" justify="center"><v-icon x-large>mdi-arrow-left-right-bold</v-icon></v-col>
                <v-col cols="5">
                    <v-card class="pa-3" color="grey lighten-4">
                    <v-img height="300" :src="nano.data.img_url1" contain>
                        <template v-slot:placeholder>
                            <v-row class="fill-height ma-0" align="center" justify="center">
                                <v-progress-circular indeterminate color="grey lighten-1"></v-progress-circular>
                            </v-row>
                        </template>
                    </v-img>
                    </v-card>
                </v-col>
            </v-row>
            <v-row class="d-flex" justify="center">
                <v-btn class="ma-3" x-large dark color="green darken-4" @click="nano.ans.choice='Same';  submit()">Same</v-btn>
                <v-btn class="ma-3" x-large dark color="green darken-1" @click="nano.ans.choice='Maybe Same';  submit()">Maybe Same</v-btn>
                <v-btn class="ma-3" x-large dark color="red darken-1"   @click="nano.ans.choice='Maybe Not Same';  submit()">Maybe Not Same</v-btn>
                <v-btn class="ma-3" x-large dark color="red darken-4"   @click="nano.ans.choice='Not Same';  submit()">Not Same</v-btn>
            </v-row>
        </v-card>
    </v-container>
</template>

<script>
import nanoMixIn from "@/mixins/nano";
export default {
    mixins: [nanoMixIn],
    data: () => ({
        defaultProps: {
            "img_url0": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qEl7SAq9L._AC_SL1000_.jpg",
            "img_url1": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQJxhbQz2Oy8Dn8ksxkaXPbzMIvhTaGUBH98P5nQ9zIXlQVV5OnWT1ozp9joA&usqp=CAc"
        }
    })
};
</script>
```

Strictly speaking, the string value `nano.data.img_url0` and `nano.data.img_url1` actually works as javascript object variables, when the attribute name of their tags has a colon prefix (i.e., `:src`).
This is a part of Vue.js' template syntax -- [a shorthand of `v-bind` directive](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html#v-bind-Shorthand) which interpolates the value of the specified variable in HTML attributes.
`nano.data` is also a reserved structure for Tutti's functionality, which means the values for the fields `img_url0` and `img_url` is loaded from one of the registered nanotasks and interpolated to the `src` attributes.
In Tutti, we call these fields for nanotasks **nano-props**.

#### Default values

So where did the cute bear images that you just saw during the test run come from?
They are defined as the placeholder values in the JavaScript code as the members of `defaultProps`.
The placeholder values are used when no nanotask is registered to the template or when you test the template in the browser console's Template page.
In the practical usage as an annotation system, you need to register nanotasks before you run the project so that dynamic image pairs are loaded.

!> `defaultProps` is a key of Vue's `data` object reserved for Tutti's functionality, defined in the `nanoMixIn` module.

In below, we explain how to upload nanotask data for `main1` template.

### Steps

1. From the side bar menu of the browser console, go to Task Flow page.

2. Click the <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M12,16A2,2 0 0,1 14,18A2,2 0 0,1 12,20A2,2 0 0,1 10,18A2,2 0 0,1 12,16M12,10A2,2 0 0,1 14,12A2,2 0 0,1 12,14A2,2 0 0,1 10,12A2,2 0 0,1 12,10M12,4A2,2 0 0,1 14,6A2,2 0 0,1 12,8A2,2 0 0,1 10,6A2,2 0 0,1 12,4Z" /></svg> icon of the card for `main1` temlate to choose "Import Nanotasks..."

3. Choose `sample-nanotasks.csv` stored in `tutti/projects/first-project/templates/main1/`. In the preview, you will see a list of image URLs for each nanotask (represented as a row) to be imported. Then click "IMPORT".

4. If you see an outlined button that says "Nanotasks (15)", it means the nanotasks were successfully imported. You can see the list of the imported nanotasks by clicking the button.

  <img src="./_media/imported-nanotasks.png" width="500" />

5. Restart Tutti service (or restart Tutti's backend service with `docker-compose restart backend`), refresh the browser console, and select **first-project** as the project name in the top navigation bar.

6. Go to "Launch in Production Mode (Private)" again and start the annotation tasks. You will see the images for `main1` template are now of URLs used in the registered nanotasks.

### Understanding nanotask CSV

Currently, the only way we prepared for uploading nanotasks is via CSV file.
`sample-nanotasks.csv` contains information in the following format:
```sample-nanotasks.csv
"img_url0","img_url1"
"<URL string 0>","<URL string 1>"
"<URL string 0>","<URL string 1>"
"<URL string 0>","<URL string 1>"
"<URL string 0>","<URL string 1>"
"<URL string 0>","<URL string 1>"
"<URL string 0>","<URL string 1>"
...
```

The first row lists the nano-prop field names, each of which is quoted by doublequotes `"` and separated by comma `,`.
Each row from the second row to the bottom row represents nano-prop values of a nanotask, with the same quotechars and delimiters.
